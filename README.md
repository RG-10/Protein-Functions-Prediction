# 🧬Protein Function Prediction through Amino Acid Sequences🧬

  >**Usama Raheem** |

## Goal🧬
Classification of protein function based on their sequences. 

**The protein function  which the project focusses is the ATP binding.**

# Data collection🧬

Data scraping was performed on several protein sequence and their function from biological databases mainly [Unitprot](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03960).

>**data-scrapes** contains the sequence in the fasta format and annotation of the various proteins.

# Approach🧬 
The sequence of the protein were augmented after 500 residues. The sequences, which had lower length were artifically padded with '_'.
We used Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to classify the protein function (obtained after hyperparameter tuninng) :  

|     Method    |   Numbers
| ------------- | ------------- |
|      ANN    | 2/3  layers |
| Embedding dim  | 10      |
| Sequence length | 23 |
| Optimizer     | Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)   |
| Loss | Binary crossentropy | 
| Nodes | 128|
|Batch size | 128 |
|Learning Rate | 0.001 |
|Accuracy Score | 0.80 |
